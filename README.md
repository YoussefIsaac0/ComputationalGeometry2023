# ComputationalGeometry2023
<h1>This is the complete code of the computational geometry syllabus in FCIS</h1>
<h3> This repo will be updated with the second milestone once it's delivered</h3>
<h5>This repo is meant to be for educational purposes only and to help other students understand the code flow.</h5>
<h6>In all functions in ms1, we take a set of points as inputs, and we output the points representing the points that form the convex hull.nn <br>
In ms2 we take a polygon as input and we output lines representing the lines needed to form the trangulation of the polygon.</h6>
<h6>In order to use the gui in ms2, the inputs will be in lines not in polygons</h6>
<p>Inserting Diagonals & Subtracting ears & Monotone Triangulation Done</p>
<p>there will be 2 separate codes for ms2, will be updated by the end of the semester.</p>
