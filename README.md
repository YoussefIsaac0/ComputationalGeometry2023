# ComputationalGeometry2023
<h1>This is the complete code of the computational geometry syllabus in FCIS</h1>
<h3>this repo will be updated with the second milestone once it's delivered</h3>
<h5>This repo is meant to be for educational purposes only and to help other students to understand the flow of the code.</h5>
**Note:** All functions in ms1 we take set of points as inputs, and we ouput the points representing the points that form the convex hull.
In ms2 we take polygon as input and we output lines representing the lines needed to form the trangulation of the polygon.
